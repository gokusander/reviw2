Can you imagine creating JWPUBs with a language as simple as HTML? Reviw is an open source markup language, written in HTML, that allows you to create JWPUB documents with ease. Based on the **JWLV API**, Reviw offers you a high-level interface that allows you to view your documents identical to how JW Library does.

Reviw is a free, ad-free, and open source tool that is available to everyone.

**What are you waiting for to try it?**

**I do not accept donations for Reviw.** Instead, I would prefer that you consider directing your financial support to [Donate to Jehovah's Witnesses](https://donate.jw.org/), a cause that I believe is of great value. importance. If [Donate to Jehovah's Witnesses](https://donate.jw.org/) is not available in your region, I encourage you to make a donation to one of the nonprofit organizations I support, such as the [Project Tor](https://donate.torproject.org/) or [Tails](https://tails.net/), or projects from [my repositories](https://github.com/livrasand?tab=repositories ) that accept donations.

**I do not promote or endorse the creation of products, services or any other initiative related to Reviw that is intended to generate income, and we discourage Reviw users from acquiring or participating in projects that seek financial benefits at the expense of the Reviw community**.

## Why Reviw?
The fundamental purpose of Reviw is to **have control** over the creation of custom JWPUBs, **be centralized** and **review on a file-by-file basis** to prevent users from attempting to unauthorizedly interfere with JW services Library, modify the JW Library application in an inappropriate manner, or distribute content that may be harmful.

Reviw has been developed to establish **a centralized system** with **human review by Jehovah's Witness members of recognized fidelity** and supported by **artificial intelligence**. This measure seeks to **prevent the spread of inappropriate or potentially harmful content**, such as apostate content, the distribution of illegal controlled substances, weapons, pirated material, instructions for illegal activities, copyright violations, harmful content or any type adult content.

**Control:** Reviw allows you to have control over the content that is shared on JWPUB Catalog services. This helps protect users from inappropriate or harmful content.

**Centralization:** Reviw is a centralized system, which means that all files are reviewed by a team of Jehovah's Witnesses. This helps ensure that the review process is consistent and efficient.

**File-by-file review:** Reviw reviews each file individually. This helps ensure that no inappropriate or harmful files are overlooked.

### üîê How does security work?
The following is an example of how Reviw could be applied to a specific file:

A user attempts to upload a JWPUB that contains apostate content. The file is reviewed by a team of Jehovah's Witnesses and artificial intelligence, who determine that the content is inappropriate. The file is rejected and the user is notified that their account has been banned. The user is identified as a potential violator of the terms of service.

From this moment on, the user will be prohibited from creating JWPUBs with Reviw again. Additionally, your account will be identified by Reviw's algorithms to recognize patterns and find you in potential new fake accounts. In case the user tries to create a new account to bypass the ban, their new account will also be rejected and their IP address will be blocked. Reviw's policy is strong and explicit to discourage users from attempting to share inappropriate or harmful content. Users who violate the terms of service will be identified and banned from using Reviw.

**Reviw is an important tool that helps protect users from inappropriate or harmful content.**

## How does Reviw work?
Our CDNs act as intermediaries that allow your HTML files to be uploaded and delivered with our **JWLV** API, Reviw uses these CDNs to provide an accurate representation of your HTML files in a JW Library-like environment, allowing you to get an accurate idea of what your projects will look like before publishing them. This makes it easy to review and optimize your work during the development process.

Reviw is a language that empowers JWPUB developers by simplifying writing HTML code. With Reviw, you can create expressions (abbreviations) similar to a conversation and convert them into code snippets with the press of a key. For example, this abbreviation:

```html
create>copyright
```

...will expand into:

```html
<div class="copyrightInfo">
    <p id="p$1" data-pid="$1" class="yes">April 2023 printing</p>
    <p id="p$2" data-pid="$2" class="yes">¬© 2021 WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY OF PENNSYLVANIA</p>
</div>
```

## Start programming
I strongly recommend that you check out the [Reviw documentation](https://livrasand.github.io/Reviw/). There you will find all the existing components of a JWPUB, colors, fonts and more rules.

Learn how to create your own JWPUB in our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md), they contain a lot of information, take your time and read these instructions carefully.

If you are a beginner in JWPUBs, you can start by [Getting started](https://github.com/livrasand/Reviw/wiki/Getting-started), understand what a JWPUB is and how it works.
